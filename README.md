# Final-Project-The-Big-Fast-Food-War
Social Media Analytics with Twitter. 

This project analyzes social media analysis on McDonald's, Burger King, and Chick-fil-A. 

This project also includes data mining using Twitter API, descriptive, content, sentiment, topic modeling, and network analysis. 

All the codes have been run and fully functional in my Jupyter notebook. 

There is also a presentation (2 ppt files) to this project and have audio explanation on each slide. 

Please note that the Jupyter notebook file may be too big so it may fail to load in the Github page. But, if you keep reloading until it loads successfully, it will work.
